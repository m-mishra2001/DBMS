A database is a collection of data that is organized, which is also called structured data. It can be accessed or stored in a computer system.
It can be managed through a Database Management System (DBMS), a software used to manage data. Database refers to related data in a structured form.

# What is DBMS
Before learning DBMS lets take an example like suppose you have given a task to store name , phone no.,class of the student now some 
may use note pad to store data,some may use diary to store it etc its traditinal file system way to store data now this type of storing 
is sutable only if we need to store 5-10 records 
but what if we wanna store 1000 students data ,in that case this type of storing system creates a problem

also if i want to show only student name and wanna hide other fields ,then in that case i need to copy data in another file .in this case if i want to 
make changes in one file then i also have to update all the files contain redundant data

so we are facing 
- redundancy
- Inconsistancy 

in traditional file system

This Problem is resolved by DBMS

A dbms is a software that acts as a interface between the database and user , user can retrive and add data through queries .In this way user does not directly 
interacting with database

Database Management System (DBMS) is a software for storing and retrieving users’ data while considering appropriate security measures. 
It consists of a group of programs which manipulate the database. The DBMS accepts the request for data from an application and instructs the operating system to provide the specific data.
In large systems, a DBMS helps users and other third-party software to store and retrieve data.


DBMS allows users to create their own databases as per their requirement.
The term “DBMS” includes the user of the database and other application programs.
It provides an interface between the data and the software application.
